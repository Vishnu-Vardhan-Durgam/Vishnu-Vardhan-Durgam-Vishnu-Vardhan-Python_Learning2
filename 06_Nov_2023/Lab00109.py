# Encapsulation
# Data members (attributes) and methods together in the class
# Person --> name , age and eat() , sleep()

# Public member
#  Public members have no special naming convention in python and are accessible from anywhere
#  They can be accessed directly from outside the class and other modules

------------------------------

# Protected Member
# Protected members are denoted by a single underscore prefix (_)
# They can still be accessed from outside the class but it is considered a
# best practice not to do directly

---------------------------------

# Private member
# Private members are denoted by a double underscore prefix(__)
# Private members are intended to be used within the class only
